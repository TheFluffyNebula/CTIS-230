    <h2>One</h2>
    <p>
"Both spent years being told that they weren't good enough. That they would never achieve what they would become.
Both were constantly disrespected, stigmatized, and ridiculed because they did not fit into what others thought they should be.
Both were able to succeed even though everyone else wanted them to fail.
Both have a huge chip on their shoulder because no matter what they accomplish, how many challenges they overcome,
and how much they prove themselves, they will never get the respect they deserve."

    <h2>Two</h2>
Now listen close, now listen well<br>
I have a tale to tell <br>
It starts not here, in mortal life <br>
but starts two steps from hell<br>
<br>
Two steps you say, Two steps indeed!<br>
Tho' Demons sought the fray.<br>
We fixed our spears and set our shields.<br>
For none shall bar our way!<br>
<br>
Two steps from hell, Two steps from pain<br>
And two from straits of blood <br>
We knew that should we there be slain<br>
we'd walk where Gods have trod.<br>
<br>
We saw the blood, we saw the fear<br>
and still we battled on.<br>
our foe had asked, "why stay ye here?<br>
when half your men are gone."<br>
<br>
I heard the cry, I heard the shout<br>
We answered in reply<br>
We took his taunt and hurled it back<br>
"We've come to win or die!"<br>
<br>
I see that day, I see that night<br>
that night where demons screamed<br>
Where shadows danced and comrades died<br>
all hope was lost, it seemed.<br>
<br>
We faced the lord, we faced that foe<br>
the last, the lord of sin.<br>
My friend and I, the last to stand<br>
His horde had slain my kin.<br>
<br>
That night I cried, That night I prayed<br>
for strength to carry on<br>
For might to fight and will to stand<br>
for hope when hope was gone.<br>
<br>
I stood with hope, I stood with strength<br>
I stood and swung my sword.<br>
for the souls of my brethren<br>
I struck and then I roared<br>
<br>
We'll not give up, we'll not give in<br>
We'll always fight this tide.<br>
I swung my sword and with a groan<br>
That prince of Darkness died<br>
<br>
I sat in blood, I sat in gore<br>
and I knew that we'd won<br>
We'd slain the beast and lived to tell<br>
the tale of Veldann's fall.<br>

    <h2>Three</h2>
Then, he smiles. It's not his secret smile or a suspicious one. Instead, it's everything I could have hoped for.
Genuine, honest, full of warmth, like the little boy he'd once been, sitting by the lamplight in his father's repair shop
and piecing together something that would change everything forever.

    <h2>Four</h2>
"Hey," he says gently. She's alert enough to realize he's holding her hand. Perhaps he's been holding it for a while.
"Hey," she says back, her voice gravelly and rough. "Weren't we just... running? Yes, there was something going on, and we were running..."
His smile broadens. Tears fill his eyes. They drop slowly, as if gravity itself has become less adamant, less demanding.
"When was that?" Citra asks.
"Only a moment ago," Rowan tells her. "Only a moment ago."

    <h2>Five</h2>
"He jerked back from me, more ordinary color flushing into his cheeks. His eyes cleared for a moment;
he looked back at Patience, and then he laughed once--he laughed, a short laugh, and it was awful.
He turned to me and said, 'El, I love you so much.' And then he shoved me through the gate."

    <h2>Six</h2>
Somehow, broken and unbound and rebound, we have survived.
And as the first hint of sun peeks over the edge of the horizon, washing the city in a ray of gold, I lift my hands and sign.
"May there be future dawns."
The others all answer with the same sign. Even Red does. "May there be future dawns."
