    <h2>One</h2>
    <div class="ParagraphOne"><p class="spoken">
        "Both spent years being told that they weren't good enough. That they would never achieve what they would
        become.
        Both were constantly disrespected, stigmatized, and ridiculed because they did not fit into what others thought
        they should be.
        <strong>Both were able to succeed even though everyone else wanted them to fail.</strong>
        Both have a huge chip on their shoulder because no matter what they accomplish, how many challenges they
        overcome,
        and how much they prove themselves, they will never get the respect they deserve."
    </p></div>
    <h2>Two</h2>
    <pre class="poem">
    Now listen close, now listen well
    I have a tale to tell 
    It starts not here, in mortal life 
    but starts two steps from hell
    
    Two steps you say, Two steps indeed!
    Tho' Demons sought the fray.
    We fixed our spears and set our shields.
    For none shall bar our way!
    
    Two steps from hell, Two steps from pain
    And two from straits of blood 
    We knew that should we there be slain
    we'd walk where Gods have trod.
    
    We saw the blood, we saw the fear
    and still we battled on.
    our foe had asked, "why stay ye here?
    when half your men are gone."
    
    I heard the cry, I heard the shout
    We answered in reply
    We took his taunt and hurled it back
    "We've come to win or die!"
    
    I see that day, I see that night
    that night where demons screamed
    Where shadows danced and comrades died
    all hope was lost, it seemed.
    
    We faced the lord, we faced that foe
    the last, the lord of sin.
    My friend and I, the last to stand
    His horde had slain my kin.
    
    That night I cried, That night I prayed
    for strength to carry on
    <strong>For might to fight and will to stand
    for hope when hope was gone.</strong>
    
    I stood with hope, I stood with strength
    I stood and swung my sword.
    for the souls of my brethren
    I struck and then I roared
    
    We'll not give up, we'll not give in
    We'll always fight this tide.
    I swung my sword and with a groan
    That prince of Darkness died
    
    I sat in blood, I sat in gore
    and I knew that we'd won
    We'd slain the beast and lived to tell
    the tale of Veldann's fall.

    <h2>Three</h2>
    <p class="novel">
    Then, he smiles. It's not his secret smile or a suspicious one. Instead, it's everything I could have hoped for.
    Genuine, honest, full of warmth, like the little boy he'd once been, sitting by the lamplight in his father's repair
    shop and <em>piecing together something that would change everything forever.</em>
    </p>
    <h2>Four</h2>
    <p class="novel">
    "Hey," he says gently. She's alert enough to realize he's holding her hand. Perhaps he's been holding it for a
    while.
    "Hey," she says back, her voice gravelly and rough. "Weren't we just... running? Yes, there was something going on,
    and we were running..."
    <em>His smile broadens. Tears fill his eyes. They drop slowly, as if gravity itself has become less adamant, less
    demanding.</em>
    "When was that?" Citra asks.
    "Only a moment ago," Rowan tells her. "Only a moment ago."
    </p>
    <h2>Five</h2>
    <p class="novel">
    "He jerked back from me, more ordinary color flushing into his cheeks. His eyes cleared for a moment;
    he looked back at Patience, and then he laughed once--he laughed, a short laugh, and it was awful.
    He turned to me and said, 'El, I love you so much.' And then he shoved me through the gate."
    </p>
    <h2>Six</h2>
    <p class="novel">
    Somehow, broken and unbound and rebound, we have survived.
    And as the first hint of sun peeks over the edge of the horizon, washing the city in a ray of gold, I lift my hands
    and sign.
    "May there be future dawns."
    The others all answer with the same sign. Even Red does. "May there be future dawns."
